`In what amounted to my most challenging group project by far, my group of three set out to build a marble run. A kids toy, I thought, shouldn't be that hard to make. Prof. Voth initially suggested that it might be more challenging than we expected, and boy was he right.
Problems abounded early on. We had plenty of trouble getting all of our team together for meetings, and contributions were hampered by concussion that lingered for several weeks, stymieing any chance at SolidWorks work. Beyond that, a series of prototyping failures and poor intra-group communication led to a much worse final product than hoped. These are reasons enough to leave this project on the portfolio, but the skills I gained are too significant to pass over.

`My greatest accomplishment to date in SolidWorks is the manufacture of a funnel for 3D printing. Not only was it a fairly complex part by the standards demanded of IDEAS 170, I was also committed to not waste time or filament by only doing one print. Rather than assuming that this 20+ hour print would work as a component of the marble run, I decided to learn how to use SolidWorks Motion, an add in that allows for the simulation of many part interactions. This allowed me to test the effectiveness of a marble rolling around the funnel. It took plenty of research, but the result makes me very proud to this day.

`The biggest problem we encountered in construction of our marble run's track was designing clips that would hold the track together. We made the decision to use rigid wire as a connector between different elements, something that we came to regret. The wire was hard to work with, heavy, and broke any clips we made out of Medium Density Fiberboard. 3D printed clips had to be used instead, but they took orders of magnitude longer to manufacture. The prototypes here demonstrate how one design decision, using a stiff wire instead of, for instance, tubing, can make a related design challenge nearly impossible.

`The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours.`

`While the greatest obstacle that I overcame in this project was the redesign of the portals, there were multiple other components that I had to work through. many of these were in done in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods. This led to very carefully sized tabs that did not overlap so that all necessary adhesive would be directly between each piece of paper. `}

`
My biggest takeaway from this project was the vast amount of resources that can be saved by adequately planning the entirety of the project before beginning. I have previously been more of a "dive in and try it" prototyper, spending less time initially on the conceptual work. While I am successful in that approach, I feel better able to use a more balanced, methodical process in the future.
