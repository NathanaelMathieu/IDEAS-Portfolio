`My hopper design went through many iterations as I approached a stable, reusable design. My initial design goal was to have a calculable timing mechanism; I had been told that the timing mechanism was the harder part of the hopper/timer combo, and decided to focus on a very good system from the start. This led me, almost immediately, to pendulums. Because they are periodic and fairly contained, I felt certain that they would work effectively right off the bat.

A long series of prototypes eventually led to realize first that counting each swing was difficult, and second that the weight distribution was critical to making it swing in an effective way. I ended up opting for a pickaxe-like shape that held plenty of mass far away from the center of rotation, producing a very consistent swing stabilized by the 1/4" Medium Density Fiberboard. Slots in the pendulum would hold a counter that would bounce back and forth between each side until it reached the bottom where it could make contact with a trigger.

`Design challenges arose once the pendulum had been worked out; specifically, I needed a jumping mechanism that would effectively propel the hopper without breaking it. I initially planned to have the pendulum dislodge some sort of retaining strap or clamp, triggering some sort of launch. To achieve the launch, a system of tubing held in tension with a long rod was restrained by fishing line.
After trying and failing to find a way to dislodge the fishing line reliably, a basic rocket-igniter circuit was set up to melt the line and release the rod. This had the effect of less of a hop and more of a lift-into-the-air-then-flip, but it was still covered under the definition of a hop. Best of all, it never failed a test. Reliability was one of the critical characteristics I had sought, so I was excited so have succeeded to have achieved it.

`The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours.`

`While the greatest obstacle that I overcame in this project was the redesign of the portals, there were multiple other components that I had to work through. many of these were in done in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods. This led to very carefully sized tabs that did not overlap so that all necessary adhesive would be directly between each piece of paper. `}

My biggest takeaway from this project was the vast amount of resources that can be saved by adequately planning the entirety of the project before beginning. I have previously been more of a "dive in and try it" prototyper, spending less time initially on the conceptual work. While I am successful in that approach, I feel better able to use a more balanced, methodical process in the future.
