`Hi, I'm Nate. I am a Computer Science Major in the Class of 2020 at Wesleyan University, and I use he/him pronouns.

 Since high school I've been answering the question, "What do you want to do?" with "Build Stuff." It's not a very specific goal by any means, but it speaks to my underlying desire to create. That desire has shaped much of my life. Whether it is working on coding, cooking, baking, brewing, or building, I have devoted endless hours to craft.

 I started out at Wesleyan in 2016. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to study and what my career should look like. Initially a prospective Physics major, I quickly realized that my talents and interests did not fully align with that path. Purely by chance, my pre-major advisor could not see me for a meeting during Add/Drop of my Sophomore Fall, and I met with Prof. Francis Starr, now the IDEAS Director, and learned about the program. It felt like an excellent step towards uniting my Wesleyan education with my desire to create. I dove in headfirst.`
