By viewing the space through a portal, the lighting of the space necessarily changes, affecting what the viewer sees. When the viewer looks through the space back into the room, there is a telescoping effect that focuses their attention on the small area in view. This change in perspective can be surprising as the colors that rim the portals change the way we see that limited field of view.\n"}),c.a.createElement(v,{text:'This project involved taking a poster and turning it into some sort of paper-based work. The poster I had chosen featured a grid with concentric circles of different colors rimmed with a glowing light effect. The initial plan was to make a cube with these circular "portals", as I came to call them, but upon construction of the first prototype it was clear that circles would not work. I was fixed on the portals being 3D and not stacked paper, and in order to achieve that I had to be clever about how I folded and glued the portals together. I was unable to find a cohesive way of holding them together, so I pivoted to hexagons. The flat sides were much easier to work with, as folding along the crease made a perfect area to glue to adjacent sections.\n'}),c.a.createElement(v,{text:"The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours."}),c.a.createElement(v,{text:"While the greatest obstacle that I overcame in this project was the redesign of the portals, there were multiple other components that I had to work through. many of these were in done in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods. This led to very carefully sized tabs that did not overlap so that all necessary adhesive would be directly between each piece of paper.

All three algorithms other than A* were ones that I had covered during previous classes, specifically Algorithms and Data Structures, so this project was fairly trivial. I spent much of my time considering different heuristics for A* to use.
